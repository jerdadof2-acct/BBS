## Technical Details

### Database Changes
- Added `access_level` field to users table
- Added sysop-specific database functions
- Added sysop API endpoints

### API Endpoints
All SYSOp endpoints require authentication and sysop privileges:
- `GET /api/sysop/check` - Check if user is sysop
- `GET /api/sysop/users` - Get all users
- `POST /api/sysop/user/:userId/access` - Update user access level
- `DELETE /api/sysop/user/:userId` - Delete user
- `GET /api/sysop/game-states` - Get all game states
- `GET /api/sysop/game-state/:userId/:gameName` - Get specific game state
- `POST /api/sysop/game-state/:userId/:gameName` - Save game state
- `DELETE /api/sysop/message/:messageId` - Delete message
- `DELETE /api/sysop/file/:fileId` - Delete file
- `GET /api/sysop/stats` - Get system statistics

## Tips

1. **Backup First**: Before making major changes, consider backing up the database
2. **Test Changes**: Test sysop functions in a development environment first
3. **Document Actions**: Keep track of what you change for accountability
4. **Use Responsibly**: With great power comes great responsibility!

## Future Enhancements

Potential future features:
- Activity logs for sysop actions
- Ban/unban users
- System configuration settings
- Email notifications for moderation
- Advanced statistics and analytics
- User activity monitoring
