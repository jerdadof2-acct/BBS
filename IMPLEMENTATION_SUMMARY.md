- **Express**: Simple, well-documented, widely supported

### Performance Considerations
- Terminal rendering is efficient with minimal DOM manipulation
- ANSI parsing is optimized for real-time display
- Socket.io rooms for efficient game state management
- Database queries are indexed for fast lookups

### Security
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt
- Session management with secure cookies
- Input sanitization for XSS prevention
- SQL injection protection with parameterized queries

## üéä Conclusion

This BBS simulator successfully recreates the authentic experience of 1980s/90s bulletin board systems while leveraging modern web technologies for real-time multiplayer functionality. It's a complete, working system ready for deployment and use!
